## <a name="first_sype"></a>1st Sharpen exercise

declare an integer variable named 'size' and give it the value 27 <br>
declare a String variable named 'name' and give it the value "Fido"<br>
create a Dog object named 'myDog' with the name Fido and the size 27<br>
give to the (***supposed***) integer variable named 'x' the value 22 (27 - 5)<br>

if x (value of 22) is less than 15, tell the dog to bark 8 times<br>

while x (value of 22) is greater than 3 ...<br>
tell the dog to play<br>
this is all we want to do in the loop<br>

create an array of 4 integer variables (2, 4, 6, 8) named 'numList'<br>
print out "Hello" ... probably at the command line<br>
print out "Dog: Fido" ... probably at the command line<br>
declare a String variable named 'num' and give it the value "8"<br>
declare an integer variable named 'z' and give it the value 8 by converting "8" ('num' is a String variable) into 8 (an integer value)<br>

try to ...<br>
read the file named 'myFile.txt'<br>
this is all we want to try

find out whether we were able to find the file<br>
if not, print out "File not found"<br>
this is all we want to do if we were not able to find the file<br>
